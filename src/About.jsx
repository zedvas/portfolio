        <span>hello world!</span>I’m Zahra, a software developer
        working with React, Express and Node. After diving headfirst into coding
        and emerging with a solid toolkit of tech skills from a bootcamp, I’m
        incredibly excited to start my journey in the world of software
        development. I’ve got a passion for problem-solving, a knack for
        producing innovative solutions, and a never-ending curiosity to keep
        expanding my knowledge. <br/> <br/>When I’m not busy crafting elegant code, you’ll
        find me hunched over a computer exploring the latest tech trends or
        tinkering with new tools. I’d love to connect with others who share the
        same enthusiasm for innovation so do <a href="/contact">say hello</a>!
